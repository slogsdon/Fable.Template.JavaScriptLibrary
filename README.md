# Sample Fable JavaScript Library

Sample project describing the use of Fable and F# to develop a JavaScript library

## Requirements

* [dotnet SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core) 2.0 or higher
* [node.js](https://nodejs.org) 6.11 or higher
* A JS package manager: [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com) or [`npm`](http://npmjs.com/)

> `npm` comes bundled with node.js, but we recommend to use at least `npm` 5. If you have `npm` installed, you can upgrade it by running `npm install -g npm`.

Although is not a Fable requirement, on macOS and Linux you'll need [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/) for other F# tooling like Paket or editor support.

## Editor

The project can be used by editors compatible with the new .fsproj format, like VS Code + [Ionide](http://ionide.io/), Emacs with [fsharp-mode](https://github.com/fsharp/emacs-fsharp-mode) or [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/). **Visual Studio for Mac** is also compatible but in the current version the package auto-restore function conflicts with Paket so you need to disable it: `Preferences > Nuget > General`.

## Building the library

> In the commands below, `yarn` is the tool of choice. If you want to use npm, just replace `yarn` by `npm` in the commands.

1. Install JS dependencies: `yarn install`
2. **Move to `src` folder**: `cd src`
3. Install F# dependencies: `dotnet restore`
4. Start Fable daemon, and run [`fable-splitter`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fable-splitter): `dotnet fable yarn-build`

> `dotnet fable yarn-build` (or `npm-build`) is used to start the Fable daemon and run a script in `package.json` concurrently. It's a shortcut of `yarn-run [SCRIPT_NAME]`, e.g. `dotnet fable yarn-run build`.

When you want to output the JS code to disk, run `dotnet fable yarn-build` in `./src`, and you'll get a JS bundle in the `dist` folder.

As a convenience, `cd src && dotnet` is exposed as a script within `package.json`, allowing the use of `dotnet` tools from the project root, e.g. `yarn dotnet fable yarn-build`.

## Project structure

### Paket

[Paket](https://fsprojects.github.io/Paket/) is the package manager used for F# dependencies. It doesn't need a global installation, the binary is included in the `.paket` folder. Other Paket related files are:

- **`paket.dependencies`**: contains all the dependencies in the repository.
- **`paket.references`**: there should be one such a file next to each `.fsproj` file.
- **`paket.lock`**: automatically generated, but should be committed to source control, [see why](https://fsprojects.github.io/Paket/faq.html#Why-should-I-commit-the-lock-file).
- **`Nuget.Config`**: prevents conflicts with Paket in machines with some Nuget configuration.

> Paket dependencies will be installed in the `packages` directory. See [Paket website](https://fsprojects.github.io/Paket/) for more info.

### `yarn`/`npm`

- **`package.json`**: contains the JS dependencies together with other info, like development scripts.
- **`yarn.lock`**: is the lock file created by `yarn`, if you use it instead of `npm`.
- **`package-lock.json`**: is the lock file understood by `npm` 5, if you use it instead of `yarn`.

> JS dependencies will be installed in `node_modules`. See [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com) and/or [`npm`](http://npmjs.com/) websites for more info.

### `fable-splitter`

[`fable-splitter`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fable-splitter) is a JS client for Fable that compiles F# files to individual JS files.

- **`splitter.config.js`**: is the configuration file for `fable-splitter`. It allows you to set a few configurable things, like the path of the bundle or [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) options.

### F# source files

The template only contains two F# source files: the project (`.fsproj`) and a source file (`.fs`) in `src` folder.
