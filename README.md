# Fable.Template.JavaScriptLibrary

`dotnet new` template for building JavaScript projects with Fable + FSharp

## Requirements

* [dotnet SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core) 2.0 or higher
* [node.js](https://nodejs.org) 6.11 or higher
* A JS package manager: [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com) or [`npm`](http://npmjs.com/)

> `npm` comes bundled with node.js, but we recommend to use at least `npm` 5. If you have `npm` installed, you can upgrade it by running `npm install -g npm`.

Although is not a Fable requirement, on macOS and Linux you'll need [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/) for other F# tooling like Paket or editor support.

## Installation

dotnet new -i Fable.Template.JavaScriptLibrary
